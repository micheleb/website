          I'm a freelance Software Engineer based in Berlin, Germany. I've been
          developing web and mobile apps professionally for {developingFor} (and

          Originally a Backend Developer (working with Java, Kotlin, and Python,

          transitioned to a Full Stack role with React on the Frontend, and
          eventually shifted focus to mobile and TV app development with React
          Native, which I've been doing for {rnFor}.
